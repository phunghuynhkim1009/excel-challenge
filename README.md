Module 1 Challenge
•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
-	“film & video”, “music”, and “theatre” are the most popular project based on the parent category
-	Within above 3 parent categories, “play” sub-category is the most picked project ( 344 out of 697 or 49%)
-	Within above 3 parent categories, the month of June and July had highest successful rate

  
•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
-	Missing the failed reasons
-	Are goals realistic?

  
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
-	Table/graph of average donation vs. parent/sub-category would provide an insight of what parent/sub-category can be focus on. If the average donation is high but the backers count is less, it should be a focus area for improvement.
-	The delta of end/start date conversion is the duration of the project. There may be some relations between the duration vs. percent funded and/or goal.


•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
-	Mean is better to summarize the data in this case because from the mean of each project, we can multiply to the mean of the average donation to establish the trend. For example, next year if there are 2x amount of projects, so we can estimate the total revenue is 2*(mean of backer count) *(average donation) *(amount of project this year)

  
•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
-	It is very interesting when analyzing the average donation, both successful and failed have a very similar value, though the min of successful rate is relatively higher than the failed. This doesn’t make sense when comparing two factors such as backer count and ave. donation. If those 2 factors are not much different, we should reconsider the goal (as mention above), that may the main factor which justify the project is successful or not.
